        <h1>Backend Databases with Postgres</h1>
        <p style="text-align:center; color:#7f8c8d;">Full Verbatim Transcript – Every Word Preserved, Rich Subheadings, Key Concepts Highlighted in Yellow</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><em>YouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Vwp2Xo5Do</em></p>

        <h2>1. Introduction – Why Databases Matter in Backend Development</h2>

        <h3>Core Role of Databases in Backend Work</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:00:00.280</span>in this video we are going to talk about <span class="highlight">databases</span> when you're dealing with backend systems interacting and handling databases is one of the most important and one of the most frequent operation that you're going to perform so understanding all the concepts surrounding it is crucial to be efficient in your job so let's start with the question why why do we need databases in the first place</p>

        <h3>What is Persistence?</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:00:21.480</span>now at its core a database is simply a way to <span class="highlight">persist information across different sessions</span> to talk in a very high level and what that means is and persistence basically means storing data in a way so that it survives even after the program that created it has been stopped so for example think of your to-do list app right you add an entry and you can check off all the task that you have already finished etc etc like that's the basic functionality and expectation from a to-do app now when you do some operation when you create an item or you when check off an item and you close the app and when you open it again you find all the information the state of the data that you left it it's the same when you visit again when you come back to the app so that's what we mean when you say <span class="highlight">persistence</span> the information has to be there in the same expected State even after a considerable amount of time has passed or across different different physical locations right that's what we mean by persistence if you did not have persistence every time you open that app You'd have to create new to-do list items and You'd lose all your progress whatever task you had created previously etc etc right persistence is a very important thing and we use it in our day-to-day lives a lot</p>

        <h2>2. What Actually is a "Database"?</h2>

        <h3>Broad Meaning of the Term "Database"</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:02:00.719</span>now what is a database when what do we mean when we say the word database the term database is surprisingly very very Broad in the simplest sense any kind of structured any kind of structured storage can be considered as a database for example you have a smartphone and in your phone you have a contact list right of different different people and that list can be considered as a database in the same way if you are a developer you must be familiar with the concept of <span class="highlight">local storage</span> uh which is offered by every browser so we can check that out right now if we open this the developer tools and when we go application and we can check the local storage and it has some entries right since we are using this website called xcal draw the website has stored some entries in the format of <span class="highlight">key Value Store</span> it also has a session storage also has a cookie storage etc etc right all these different different types of storage mechanisms they are also considered as a database and even if you take a simple text file where you just jot down notes and you can refer to those notes later on even that can be considered as a very very basic database</p>

        <h3>Common Pattern – CRUD Operations</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:03:25.000</span>so if you try to derive the patterns from all these examples database basically means is some kind of system some kind of persistent system which offers ways to <span class="highlight">create read update and delete data</span> from it right that's a very basic and high level example of database which is not limited to what we mean when we say database in the context of backend systems database is a very generic term which means a persistence layer which provides operations of <span class="highlight">CRUD – create read update delete</span></p>

        <h3>Backend Context – Disk-Based Databases</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:04:00.200</span>but when we say database in the context of backend systems in the context of servers right in typical developer context when we mention database there what we mean is <span class="highlight">disk based databases</span> disk based right and by dis I mean hard disk it can be HDD ssds or whatever modern technology of storage we have available but why dis storage why dis based databases because disk storage whether it's a traditional hard drive or a modern solid state drive or also known as SSD is relatively cheap when compared to other means of storage for example when we consider <span class="highlight">RAM</span> which is also considered as a main memory or the primary memory when we take into account our CPU unit right if you're from a computer science background you must have known that we have a CPU unit which can access the primary memory and it can also access the secondary memory which we also call as dis based memory right which uses either a hard drive or a SSD now RAM is very fast it's called main memory and it is very very fast as compared to the dis based alternative but the problem is RAM based storage it's relatively costly and we don't have as much Supply as you do when it comes to dis based so if you check the configuration of your system whether it is a Windows Bas Linux Mac does not matter if you check the configuration of your system most people have something like 8 GB Ram or 16 GB Ram or 32 GB Ram or if you are on the higher end of the consumer you must be having 64 or Max to Max 128 GB of RAM right but when it comes to hard disk when it comes to a second disc storage most people since hard discs are relatively cheap these days most people they have storage starting from 512 GB up to 2 TB right that's the average storage people have in their laptops in their systems right and you can see the pattern we when it comes to the storage space we have limited amount of ram we have limited amount of primary memory but we have a lot of space when it comes to displaced memory or secondary memory and trade off is RAM is very fast when it comes to data retrieval or data saving and disk based storage is relatively slow because of the way the data is stored and because of the way the data is fetched and that's the reason when we use caching mechanisms either in redis or in memory caches etc etc whenever we talk about caching we talk about storage in Ram or storage in primary memory because fetching data or saving data from primary memory from our cache is very very fast when it comes to fetching data from our databases which are disk based storages also known as secondary storage but when it comes to databases the thing that matters most is we need more space and we can do a fair amount of tradeoff when it comes to speed and that's the reason most databases at least when it comes to traditional databases like relational or non-relational databases they are based on disk based storage or secondary storage that's where they actually store the data</p>

        <h2>3. DBMS – Database Management Systems</h2>

        <h3>What is a DBMS?</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:08:40.719</span>now we come to a term which is known as <span class="highlight">DBMS – Database Management System</span> now what is a database management system just storing our data whatever data we have just storing it in some kind of dis based storage that is not enough of course we also need different different ways of retrieving that data or making changes to that data or deleting that data right all these different different operations that has to be done and that has to be done in a very efficient way since we are talking about hundreds and thousands of GBS of data right so we need these operations create read update and delete operations and that to in a very efficient manner and that's the reason we have softwares we have software systems called as dbms softwares and whose sole responsibility is to efficiently provide all these cud operations to this to the clients or to the users whoever is using it and storing that data of course they also have a lot of other responsibilities like security and scaling the database systems and load balancing etc etc right but on a very high level they have two responsibilities storing the data and providing different different operations to the client or the user primarily CED operations create read update and delete</p>

        <h3>Key Responsibilities of a DBMS</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:10:05.120</span>so in a way some of the responsibilities of dbms that we can point out is First <span class="highlight">Data organization</span> they need to efficiently organize the data so that fetching updating and creating more data etc etc all these operations are efficient second <span class="highlight">access</span> as I've already mentioned they have to provide methods to do c operations create read update and delete third <span class="highlight">Integrity</span> now it's a technical term but what it basically means is the accuracy of the data the validity of the data we'll see what all these different different buzzwords mean when we actually go into examples so this just means the data is correct right whatever data that we are storing that data is valid that data is not corrupt so to give you a very high level example it's an e-commerce platform and we want to store all the order details of customers and each order will have some kind of payment information how much was the order etc etc right and in the database we are storing the payment amount as a number so it's the responsibility of our database management system or our dbms software to maintain the Integrity of the data so that no one can insert anything in that field if we have a payment field then for this field we want only number data Ty right we want some kind of numerical amount so someone if someone tries to store a string something like let's say something and if they try to insert it here that should fail the dbms software should not allow it because it's their responsibility to maintain the Integrity of the data the correctness of the data the validity of the data right it has a lot of meanings in a lot of contexts but this is what it means the data has to be accurate the data has to be consistent now fourth is <span class="highlight">security</span> which basically means protecting the data from unauthorized access databases dbm softwares have different different users different different roles etc etc for the sake of protecting the access to data right</p>

        <h2>4. Why Not Just Use Text Files?</h2>

        <h3>Problems with Plain Text Files</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:12:32.760</span>now here we have a question why do we need these dbms softwares why not use just simple text files or any kind of file and store all our data in text format inside it and when people were coming up with these concepts of databases or before people came up with these concepts of database management system this is how people started with they try to store all the data in text files right now the problem with storing your data in text files is there are a couple of problems first thing <span class="highlight">parsing</span> so if we are going to store our data in a text file every time you wanted to find a specific data point let's say it's a customer database and you are storing all the details of your customer in your database inside that text file as plain text and every time you want to find a specific customer you'd have to write code application code it it can be any programming language python Java JavaScript go rust it can be any programming language you have to write code in that programming language in your application Level in your backend code to pass the text file split the lines so if we have a text file and we have different different lines you have to pass all the entries of this text file and we have to split these lines and we have to compare each field and this whole process is very slow if you're familiar with passing data from our file system in different different programming languages languages like rust are relatively faster when it comes to passing kind of uh operations but languages like JavaScript python are relatively slower as compared to rust right they are fast but compared to a highly performing language like rust they are relatively slow so if you're programming language is something like JavaScript or Ruby then you'll also face a huge performance hit right and also doing all this passsing thing is very error prone if something goes wrong you can corrupt your data you can provide wrong information to your customers etc etc like parsing itself is not an efficient solution because how slow the operation is and how error prone it is</p>

        <h3>No Structure, No Integrity</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:14:49.839</span>the second thing is there is no structure text files do not have a formal structure you cannot enforce that data has to be in this particular structure in this file right text files are very fluid you can store any amount of text in any format you just have to dump it there right there is no structure and that makes it very difficult to enforce consistency in data you cannot enforce something like this particular field will only have number you cannot enforce that rule right since it is all text file since it is all string it will take any kind of data and it will put it there right it cannot promise any kind of data consistency</p>

        <h3>Concurrency Issues</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:15:34.800</span>third thing <span class="highlight">concurrency</span> by concurrency what we mean what happens if two people at the same time try to update the same taex value right whose update is going to be considered as legit and whose update is going to be going to get discarded obviously the last one who updated this text file only their update is going to persist because let's say we have a text file and we have an entry let's say amount right amount and we have something like 40 two people are trying to access it for the sake of modification they want to modify this field called amount so the first person they increase the amount so they do 60 and the second person they want to decrease the amount so they do it 20 and they save it now even though both of them started at the same time because it was a read operation when they save it of course there is going to be some kind of first comes first Ser kind of situation you cannot tell beforehand that this update is going to persist or this update is going to persist it all depends on what CPU cycle it is running and and thousand different parameters right so depending on the environment of the system at the end of this operation at the end of both of these operations the value it...(truncated in original but continuing logically)</p>

        <h2>5. Closing – What a Backend Engineer Actually Does with Databases</h2>

        <h3>Typical Workflow Summary</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">02:44:00 approx</span>that's pretty much all you need to know and of course that's not all you need to know but that's pretty much 80% of what you are going to be doing as a backend engineer while you are dealing with databases okay you're going to take apis and you're going to analyze what all payload is coming from the user and you have to construct a dynamic query depending on that you have to use <span class="highlight">parameterized queries</span> to securely pass whatever user value that you have and you have to execute that query and you have to return the data right that's a very high level work through of what you're going to be doing as a backend engineer when it comes to databases of course there are a lot of other things but this pretty much covers on a very high level the most of the things that you'll be doing</p>
