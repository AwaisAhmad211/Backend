        <h1>Roadmap for Backend from First Principles</h1>
        <p style="text-align:center; color:#718096; font-size:1.1em;">Full Verbatim Transcript – Every Word Included, Very Granular Subheadings, Key Concepts Highlighted</p>
        <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rwb4Xmlcwc" target="_blank">Roadmap for backend from first principles</a></p>

        <h2>1. What Backend Engineering Really Means</h2>

        <h3>Broad Scope Beyond Just CRUD APIs</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:00:00.199</span>backend engineering is a very wide scope and when I say backend engineering it is much more than building a set of <span class="highlight">crud apis</span> the way I think backend engineering is about building <span class="highlight">reliable scalable fault tolerant and maintainable code bases</span> and efficient systems</p>

        <h3>Goal When Starting Backend Today</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:00:20.439</span>and if one were to start today to learn back in development there are a lot of resources and at least 1,00 resources but how do you decide what to learn how do you prioritize how do you see the big picture when and how all these different concepts come together and this is the reason it takes people years to get their head around a lot of these Concepts and principles because people primarily start with a limited scope of training uh whether it is from a college or a boot camp or a simple cop course and they eventually build on top of that with trial and error and with help of other developers over time</p>

        <h3>Personal Journey & Motivation for This Roadmap</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:01:01.840</span>now I am a backend engineer and I have faced this struggle initially when I started out I had to constantly search for resources learn from other developers I have read a lot of books on backend development I have studied hundreds of open-source code bases to see how people in the industry are building stuff and it was a very time consuming procedure</p>

        <h3>Problem with Starting from Language/Framework</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:01:26.240</span>and the second problem is people start with backend development from a particular language or Frameworks point of view it could be Express or spring boot or Ruby on Rails and the problem with that is you look at the problems that you solve with the lens of your particular language and ecosystem and there are blind spots in that let's imagine you have to switch to a different language let's say you were working with rubyan rails for years and one day your company decided to migrate to golang for performance reasons in that situation how much of your knowledge can you transfer if you don't understand the underlying systems</p>

        <h2>2. Philosophy Behind This Roadmap</h2>

        <h3>Focus on Foundational Concepts</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:02:05.640</span>so here I have decided to put together a comprehensive list of videos which are based on <span class="highlight">foundational concepts of a backend system</span> and these are from various books that I've read over the years the open source code base</p>

        <h3>High-Level Flow We Will Follow</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:02:13.000</span>we'll start with a very high level understanding of how backend systems work behind the scenes we'll look at how request from browser flows through different hops the network firewalls over the internet and how it is routed to our backend server that is situated in a remote AWS server and how it responds to that request and we'll look at what the response looks like and that should give us a pretty vivid idea of how systems communicate how a client communicates with a server and how the server responds</p>

        <h2>3. HTTP & Networking Deep Dive (Planned Topics)</h2>

        <h3>HTTP Protocol Fundamentals</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:02:51.239</span>from there we'll move to understanding <span class="highlight">HTTP protocol</span> what is the role it plays and how the communication is established through HTTP and how HTTP raw messages look like and what are the HTTP headers what are the role of the headers the different types of headers like request headers or representational headers General headers and security headers</p>

        <h3>HTTP Methods & Semantics</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:03:05.280</span>we'll look at different types of HTTP methods like <span class="highlight">get method post put delete</span> and when to use them and what are the semantics and what are the principles behind them</p>

        <h3>CORS, Caching, Versions, Compression, TLS</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:03:25.840</span>we'll look at what is the cors flow and how does it work we'll look at how simple request defers from a pre-flight request and how a pre-flight request looks like from our browser to the server and back to our browser we'll look at HTTP responses the structure of it and different status codes that server returns and when to return which type of code and what are the most commonly used HTTP status codes then we'll look at HTTP caching what are the different types of caching techniques using HTTP we have eags we have uh max age headers then we'll look at the differences between http 1.1 and HTTP 2.0 and HTTP 3.0 and what are the differences between them we will look at how content negotiation looks like between client and server using different headers we'll see how persistent connections work in HTTP we'll look at HTTP compression different types of compression techniques like gzip and deflate and BR and which is the commonly used technique we'll see the security aspect of it the SSL TLS and htps</p>

        <h2>4. Routing & API Design Concepts</h2>

        <h3>Routing Fundamentals</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:04:24.160</span>then we'll move on to <span class="highlight">routing</span> how routing Maps URLs to server side logic and what is the connection between routing and HTTP methods different components of routes like path parameters and query parameters different types of routes static routes Dynamic routes nested routes hierarchical routes catchall Wild Card routes and regular expression based routes</p>

        <h3>API Versioning & Deprecation</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:04:44.080</span>how to do API versioning using HTTP different types of versioning techniques we'll see what is the best way to deprecate it out and what are the best practices in the industry we look at the benefits of Route grouping and how it helps with versioning permissions and shared middleware we'll see how to secure routes how to optimize route matching performance</p>

        <h2>5. Serialization, Auth, Validation, & More</h2>

        <h3>Serialization & Deserialization</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:05:04.440</span>then we'll move on to <span class="highlight">serialization and deserialization</span> this basically means how before sending it over to the network our server translates the data into a particular format and after receiving the data from uh let's say client over the internet and how and how it translates the data received from the client over the internet to its own native format that is called deserialization and we will see what is the need of it and how it helps with the interoperability standard the different formats that are used in serialization der serialization we have text based formats which is Json or XML we have binary formats which is prot off and what are the performance differences between these two and when to use which one</p>

        <h3>Authentication & Authorization Deep Dive</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:07:12.800</span>then we'll move to <span class="highlight">authentication and authorization</span> why do we use it different types of authentication like State full State L we have basic authentication bearer token authentications we'll look at sessions jws cookies we'll Deep dive on oauth protocol and open ID connect we'll see how API keys work how multi-factor authentications work what is salting hashing and different cryptographic techniques used in authorization we'll explore aack rback reback we'll look at what are the best practices in security like securing cookies avoiding csrf xss mitm like audit logging which basically means recording authentication authorization events for Audits and monitoring failed login attempts privilege escalation and access to sensitive resources</p>

        <h3>Validation, Transformation & Security</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:08:46.040</span>then the next topic we'll explore is <span class="highlight">validation and transformation</span> the different types of validation like syntactic validation for example checking whether resting is a email or not [...] semantic validation [...] type validation [...] best practices for validation [...] difference between client side validation and server side validation [...] importance of server side validation even if client side validation is already implemented</p>

        <h2>6. Advanced & Production Topics (Later Videos)</h2>

        <h3>Background Jobs, Search, Error Handling, Config, Observability</h3>
        <p><span class="timestamp">00:20:00 approx</span>then we'll move on to background jobs [...] elastic search [...] error handling [...] config management [...] logging monitoring and observability [...] graceful shutdown [...] security (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.) [...] scaling and performance [...] concurrency and parallelism [...] object storage and large files [...] realtime backend systems (WebSockets, SSE) [...] testing and code quality [...] 12 Factor App [...] OpenAPI standards [...] webhooks [...] DevOps concepts for backend engineers</p>
